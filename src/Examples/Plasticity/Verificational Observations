For locking normals on the 3 surfaces and then displacing in x direction we have uniform total and plastic strains.
The stresses are also uniform.
The Volumetric Plastic Strain is zero.
The solution of effective stress vs effective strain is satifactory for perfect plasticity as well.
For perfect plasticity, the stress is the same at the end of the plastic deformation.
